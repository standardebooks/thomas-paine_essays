Although in this essay Paine occasionally repeats sentences used elsewhere, and naturally maintains his well-known principles, the work has a peculiar interest as indicating the temper and visions of the opening revolution. <cite>—⁠Conway</cite> <a href="anti-monarchal-essay.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In his appeal from prison to the Convention (<time datetime="1794-08-07">August 7, 1794</time>) Paine states that he had, as a member of the Committee for framing the Constitution, prepared a Plan, which was in the hands of Barère, also of that Committee. I have not yet succeeded in finding Paine’s Constitution, but it is certain that the work of framing the Constitution of 1793 was mainly entrusted to Paine and Condorcet. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> John Moore, in his work on the French Revolution, describes the two at their work; and it is asserted that he “assisted in drawing up the French Declaration of Rights,” by “Juvencus,” author of an able “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.essay">Essay on the Life and Genius of Thomas Paine</span>,” whose information came from a personal friend of Paine. (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Aphorisms, Opinions, and Reflections of Thomas Paine</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, London, 1826. <abbr>Pp.</abbr> 3, 14.) A translation of the Declaration and Constitution appeared in England (Debrett, Picadilly, 1793), but with some faults. The present translation is from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Œuvres Complètes de Condorcet</i>, tome <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xviii</span>. The Committee reported their Constitution <time datetime="1793-02-15">February 15th</time>, and <time datetime="1793-04-15">April 15th</time> was set for its discussion, Robespierre then demanded separate discussion of the Declaration of Rights, to which he objected that it made no mention of the Supreme Being, and that its extreme principles of freedom would shield illicit traffic. Paine and Jefferson were troubled that the United States Constitution contained no Declaration of Rights, it being a fundamental principle in Paine’s theory of government that such a Declaration was the main safeguard of the individual against the despotism of numbers. <cite>—⁠Conway</cite> <a href="declaration-of-rights.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Printed from the first edition, whose title is as above, with the addition: “By Thomas Paine, Author of Common Sense; Rights of Man; Age of Reason. Paris, Printed at the English Press, <span xml:lang="fr">rue de Vaugerard</span>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 970. Third year of the French Republic.” The pamphlet seems to have appeared early in <time datetime="1795-07">July (perhaps the Fourth), 1795</time>, and was meant to influence the decision of the National Convention on the Constitution then under discussion. This Constitution, adopted <time datetime="1795-09-23">September 23rd</time>, presently swept away by Napoleon, contained some features which appeared to Paine reactionary. Those to which he most objected are quoted by him in his speech in the Convention, which is bound up in the same pamphlet, and follows this “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.essay">Dissertation</span>” in the present volume. In the Constitution as adopted Paine’s preference for a plural Executive was established, and though the bicameral organization (the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients) was not such as he desired, his chief objection was based on his principle of manhood suffrage. But in regard to this see Paine’s “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.essay">Dissertations on Government</span>,” written nine years before, where he indicates the method of restraining the despotism of numbers. <cite>—⁠Conway</cite> <a href="dissertation-on-first-principles-of-government.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This pamphlet, as Paine predicts at its close (no doubt on good grounds), was translated into all languages of Europe, and probably hastened the gold suspension of the Bank of England (1797), which it predicted.

There is in the French Archives an order for 1,000 copies, <time datetime="1796-04-27">April 27, 1796</time>, nineteen days after Paine’s pamphlet appeared.</p>

					<p>The actual expense of the war of 1739 did not come up to the sum ascertained by the ratio. But as that which is the natural disposition of a thing, as it is the natural disposition of a stream of water to descend, will, if impeded in its course, overcome by a new effort what it had lost by that impediment, so it was with respect to this war and the next (1756) taken collectively; for the expense of the war of 1756 restored the equilibrium of the ratio, as fully as if it had not been impeded. A circumstance that serves to prove the truth of the ratio more folly than if the interruption had not taken place. The war of 1739 was languid; the efforts were below the value of money et that time; for the ratio is the measure of the depreciation of money in consequence of the funding system; or what comes to the same end, it is the measure of the increase of paper. Every additional quantity of it, whether in bank notes or otherwise, diminishes the real, though not the nominal value of the former quantity. <a href="the-decline-and-fall-of-the-english-system-of-finance.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Among the delusions that have been imposed upon the nation by ministers to give a false colouring to its affairs, and by none more than by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt, is a motley, amphibious-charactered thing called the <em>balance of trade</em>. This balance of trade, as it is called, is taken from the customhouse books, in which entries are made of all cargoes exported, and also of all cargoes imported, in each year; and when the value of the exports, according to the price set upon them by the exporter or by the customhouse, is greater than the value of the imports, estimated in the same manner, they say the balance of trade is much in their favour.</p>
					<p>The customhouse books prove regularly enough that so many cargoes have been exported, and so many imported; but this is all that they prove, or were intended to prove. They have nothing to do with the balance of profit or loss; and it is ignorance to appeal to them upon that account: for the case is, that the greater the loss is in any one year, the higher will this thing called the balance of trade appear to be according to the customhouse books. For example, nearly the whole of the Mediterranean convoy has been taken by the French this year; consequently those cargoes will not appear as imports on the customhouse books, and therefore the balance of trade, by which they mean the profits of it, will appear to be so much the greater as the loss amounts to; and, on the other hand, had the loss not happened, the profits would have appeared to have been so much the less. All the losses happening at sea to returning cargoes, by accidents, by the elements, or by capture, make the balance appear the higher on the side of the exports; and were they all lost at sea, it would appear to be all profit on the customhouse books. Also every cargo of exports that is lost that occasions another to be sent, adds in like manner to the side of the exports, and appears as profit. This year the balance of trade will appear high, because the losses have been great by capture and by storms. The ignorance of the British Parliament in listening to this hackneyed imposition of ministers about the balance of trade is astonishing. It shows how little they know of national affairs⁠—and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Grey may as well talk Greek to them, as to make motions about the state of the nation.
